## Welcome to Lindsey Schader's GitHub Site

I created this site as a repository for my PhD in Biostatistics work at Emory University and for my teaching materials. I TA the introductory R course for non-BIOS students. 

### On this site you will find the following:
1. Lectures for BIOS 544
2. Links to my favorite R programming resources.
